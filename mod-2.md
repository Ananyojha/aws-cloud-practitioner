## Computer Network
group of devices that speak a common language (protocol) like My laptop (broswer) -> HTTPS -> Web server (waiting for a Https Request) --> they found each other via internet(a big network)..
- [TCP-IP network model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/)

## working of TCP-IP
> how machines find each other?
NIC Card --> SIM card --> 
1. MAC address
2. IP address

## DHCP Server
the DHCP server assigns a unique IP address to each NIC card in the network. 
In windows:
- Get Ip of Server by: ```ipconfig /all``` 
- Get MAC Address by ```arp -a``` 

## CIDR

## extended network
connect 2 different network together. In this case, make internet know about your private machine.
