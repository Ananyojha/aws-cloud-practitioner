## WHat is cloud ??
- Less Managemnt
- Global Reach
- Rapid 

> How my company can implement Cloud? ||| Assume I have to Travel from Mumbai to Pune with 10 People....
### [OPtion-1] --> Own Car ===> Private Cloud
- I buy,manage and update Pool of IT Infra used by my Employees
- Either buy car yourself (create DC Yourself) OR Via Nutanix or Openshift (A vendor)

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- on-demand self service : Help Yourself --> No human intervemntion needeed --> Just you and your cloud provider 
Example: Need a VM of 8 GB with Windows Server 2022 --> you don't configure virtualisation --> install OS ðŸš«ðŸš«  -> ask it get it
- Broad Network Connection:  cloud services must be available for remote access over the network connection, and you are not expected to walk into a the DC to access it.
It must be available to you over a network using standard mechanisms such as INTERNET using HTTPS 
- Resource Pooling ---> Hardware maintained by cloud provider ---> Customers rent accordingly
- Rapid Elasticity -->  customer of cloud services must be allowed to increase or decrease the capabilities in any quantity and at any time.
- Measured Service -> This feature means that the cloud services and resource usage are allowed to Mesa monitor, report, and control transparently to the customers.

### Cloud Service Model
1. IaaS: (got fully furnished kitchen --> Cook Food) ====> Physical Hardware maintained by cloud provider --> you build things 
2. PaaS: (Order food online) -> Baisc Infra (food) managed by the cloud provider -----> washing dishes sending invitations to guest your responsibility
3. SaaS: (go to restaurent) : EVrything fixed (menu price services) ---> use it pay for it --> M365, Gmail every fetures predecided  --> just use it

[SPOILER ALERT!] Where and How Saas Used?
AWS marketPlace: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace OR  in console search AWS MarketPlace ------> Subscribe 
- get ready to deploy services (SaaS,free, paid)
- assume it lioke Gooogle Play Store / Apple I-store

# AWS Global Infra
1. AWS Region : AWS Region is a physical location in the world ====> Asia Pacific {Geography} (Mumbai) ===> ap-south-1
* Console top right shows Resources from that region (VPC,EC2 etc)
* Contains 1+ AZ
2. Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities
3. [show in AWS console go to Oregon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/getting-started.html#getting-started-find-local-zone)
4. Local Zone: like Oregon (us-west-2) --> Los Angeles is a few 100 miles away from the Northern California region. But Los Angeles local Zone is connected to the California region. due to very high traffic 
5. Wavelength: AWS Wavelength embeds AWS compute and storage services within 5G networks, providing mobile edge computing infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling ultra-low-latency applications
6. Edge Network locations :Networking services Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 sit at AWSâ€™ global edge locations connected by dedicated 100Gbps redundant fiber to deliver data with single digit millisecond AWS network latency.
7. aws outposts = Azure stack = search in portal about outposts

## Demonstration:
1. AWS Service Categories: Services -----> See list
2. Creating AWS account -> AWS Free tier
3. create IAM user for New account -> create a aws service
4. aws pricing calculator
