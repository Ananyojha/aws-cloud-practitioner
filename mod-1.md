> you are a global food company. Your compettitors are embracing modern tools and tech to give better and faster customer experince. You want to give tough fight to compettitors. You plan to luanch an app so that customers can order healthy and tasty food directly from you. You already have a multiple datacenters in India and Europe. Your CTO says Cloud cna help us FOCUS ON revenue-generating activities as opposed to managing infra. Now you are in a meeting to learn more about cloud and it's benefits.

# Read Slide -> Explain it -> Relate it -> show it 
## What is cloud ??
- Less Managemnt
- Global Reach
- Rapid 

> How my company can implement Cloud? ||| Assume I have to Travel from Mumbai to Pune with 10 People....
### [OPtion-1] --> Own Car ===> Private Cloud
- I buy,manage and update Pool of IT Infra used by my Employees
- Either buy car yourself (create DC Yourself) OR Via Nutanix or Openshift (A vendor)

### Slides

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- on-demand self service : Help Yourself --> No human intervemntion needeed --> Just you and your cloud provider 
Example: Need a VM of 8 GB with Windows Server 2022 --> you don't configure virtualisation --> install OS ðŸš«ðŸš«  -> ask it get it
- Broad Network Connection:  cloud services must be available for remote access over the network connection, and you are not expected to walk into a the DC to access it.
It must be available to you over a network using standard mechanisms such as INTERNET using HTTPS 
- Resource Pooling ---> Hardware maintained by cloud provider ---> Customers rent accordingly
- Rapid Elasticity -->  customer of cloud services must be allowed to increase or decrease the capabilities in any quantity and at any time.
- Measured Service -> This feature means that the cloud services and resource usage are allowed to Mesa monitor, report, and control transparently to the customers.

### Cloud Service Model
1. IaaS: (got fully furnished kitchen --> Cook Food) ====> Physical Hardware maintained by cloud provider --> you build things 
2. PaaS: (Order food online) -> Baisc Infra (food) managed by the cloud provider -----> washing dishes sending invitations to guest your responsibility
3. SaaS: (go to restaurent) : EVrything fixed (menu price services) ---> use it pay for it --> M365, Gmail every fetures predecided  --> just use it

[SPOILER ALERT!] Where and How Saas Used?
AWS marketPlace: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace OR  in console search AWS MarketPlace ------> Subscribe 
- get ready to deploy services (SaaS,free, paid)
- assume it lioke Gooogle Play Store / Apple I-store

# AWS Global Infra
1. AWS Region : AWS Region is a physical location in the world ====> Asia Pacific {Geography} (Mumbai) ===> ap-south-1
* Console top right shows Resources from that region (VPC,EC2 etc)
* Contains 1+ AZ
2. Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities
3. [show in AWS console go to Oregon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/getting-started.html#getting-started-find-local-zone)
4. Local Zone: like Oregon (us-west-2) --> Los Angeles is a few 100 miles away from the Northern California region. But Los Angeles local Zone is connected to the California region. due to very high traffic 
5. Wavelength: AWS Wavelength embeds AWS compute and storage services within 5G networks, providing mobile edge computing infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling ultra-low-latency applications
6. Edge Network locations :Networking services Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 sit at AWSâ€™ global edge locations connected by dedicated 100Gbps redundant fiber to deliver data with single digit millisecond AWS network latency.
7. aws outposts = Azure stack = search in portal about outposts

## Demonstration:
1. AWS Service Categories: Services -----> See list
2. Creating AWS account -> AWS Free tier
3. create IAM user for New account -> create a aws service
4. aws pricing calculator

 # ACCORDING TO SKILL OUTLINE 
 
 1. [Software costs savings when moving to cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/license-compliance-during-migration-to-aws/)
 2. [Right Sizing](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-optimization/right-sizing/)
 3. `aws s3 ls | awk '{print$3}'` --> lists all the s3 buckets with only there names

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# get a list of all available buckets
buckets=$(aws s3 ls | awk '{print $3}')

# loop through each bucket
for bucket in $buckets
do
    # get the count of objects inside the bucket
    count=$(aws s3 ls s3://$bucket --recursive | wc -l)
    
    # if the count is greater than 0, delete all objects inside the bucket
    if [ $count -gt 0 ]
    then
        echo "Deleting objects in bucket $bucket ..."
        aws s3 rm s3://$bucket --recursive
    fi
    
    # delete the bucket
    echo "Deleting bucket $bucket ..."
    aws s3 rb s3://$bucket --force
done

`Design for failure`: This design principle involves designing your system to be resilient to failures by assuming that failures can and will happen. Instead of trying to prevent failures, the focus is on minimizing the impact of failures by designing for redundancy, fault tolerance, and self-healing. This means that when one component fails, the system can automatically switch to a backup component, reducing or eliminating downtime. Designing for failure is particularly important in cloud environments where failures can occur more frequently due to the distributed nature of the system.

`Decouple components versus monolithic architecture:` This design principle involves breaking down a system into smaller, loosely-coupled components instead of using a monolithic architecture. A monolithic architecture is a single, tightly-coupled system where all components are dependent on each other. By decoupling components, you can improve scalability, flexibility, and reliability. Each component can be scaled independently and upgraded without impacting the rest of the system. This allows for more agile development, deployment, and maintenance.

`Implement elasticity in the cloud versus on-premises`: This design principle involves taking advantage of the elasticity of cloud resources to scale up or down as needed. In traditional on-premises environments, scaling often requires significant investment in hardware and infrastructure. In the cloud, scaling can be achieved by provisioning additional resources on-demand and decommissioning resources when they are no longer needed. This allows for more efficient resource utilization and cost optimization.

`Think parallel`: This design principle involves designing systems to be parallel and distributed, allowing workloads to be divided into smaller, more manageable tasks that can be processed in parallel. This can improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. Parallel processing can be achieved through techniques such as sharding, partitioning, and distributed computing. By thinking parallel, you can design systems that can handle large-scale workloads with ease and provide a seamless user experience.
