### Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- on-demand self service : Help Yourself --> No human intervemntion needeed --> Just you and your cloud provider 
Example: Need a VM of 8 GB with Windows Server 2022 --> you don't configure virtualisation --> install OS ğŸš«ğŸš«  -> ask it get it
- Broad Network Connection:  cloud services must be available for remote access over the network connection, and you are not expected to walk into a the DC to access it.
It must be available to you over a network using standard mechanisms such as INTERNET using HTTPS 
- Resource Pooling ---> Hardware maintained by cloud provider ---> Customers rent accordingly
- Rapid Elasticity -->  customer of cloud services must be allowed to increase or decrease the capabilities in any quantity and at any time.
- Measured Service -> This feature means that the cloud services and resource usage are allowed to Mesa monitor, report, and control transparently to the customers.

2. PaaS: (Order food online) -> Baisc Infra (food) managed by the cloud provider -----> washing dishes sending invitations to guest your responsibility
3. SaaS: (go to restaurent) : EVrything fixed (menu price services) ---> use it pay for it --> M365, Gmail every fetures predecided  --> just use it
