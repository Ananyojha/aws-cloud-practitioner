[Root Users - actions that only he can perform..](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)

*Types of Uses for IAM*:
1. Service Admin: I work with only RDS / DynamoDB / Redshift / atena - I am a DBA
2. I am the developer Manager - so I decide who, uses which services
3. IAM admin: his work only to grant take away permisssions.
